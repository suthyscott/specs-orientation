# specs-orientation

- Morning/Evening standups/reviews
  - Attendance is taken based on who has cameras on when the meeting starts. Message me at the beginning of the standup if you are unable to have your camera on.
  - Morning: we'll go around and ask "what's your status?" and "what are your goals for the day?" (you should have at least one goal.
  - EoD: "what did you accomplish today?" and if you got blocked on anything.
  - Don't hesitate to say if you're stuck on anything, just like you'll need to in the field.

- The structure of specs:
  - Think of tech leads as your professors
  - Think of Frodo as the syllabus
  - Think of Udemy as the textbook
  - Your main goals every week should be completing the projects, and understanding the objectives of the projects. 
  - In the standups each week we will build projects that mirror the unit projects, the goal being to teach and review all the core content each week in live standup instruction.

- Unit Projects overview (what they can expect)
  - only the unit projects are graded. There will be projects in the udemy course and we highly encourage you to complete them all, but they are not required. 
  - each project is organized into approximately 5 parts, so you should shoot to complete a part every day. 
  - moving faster than that is cool, but you don't want to fall behind. If you finish early I can supply bonus content. **If you start to fall behind or don't finish the unit project on time, tell me as soon as possible.**
  - each project has an MVP, Code requirements and objectives. Pay attention to this, go over them before and after doing each project. This is a pattern you'll need to replicate for your capstone. 
  - There is a solution file. Obviously use it with descretion, but it's there for a reason. 
- Queue
  - It's really important to struggle and really try yourself before getting help. 
  - We WANT you to use the queue. The template is absolutely not meant to be a deterrant. But it's vital that you develop independent debugging and learning skills during the course. 
- AI tools (ChatGPT, GitHub Co-pilot)
  - These tools are super useful and we encourage you to use them, but make sure they are not replacing your learning! Use them for debugging and learning/understanding new concepts, but never use them to write code for you.
