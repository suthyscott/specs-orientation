- Morning/Evening standups/reviews
- How to navigate Specs Discord
- The structure of specs:
  - Think of tech leads as your professors
  - Think of Frodo as the syllabus
  - Think of Udemy as the textbook
  - Your main goals every week should be completing the projects, and understanding the objectives of the projects. 
- How to Navigate Frodo in Specs
- How to navigate Udemy
- Unit Projects overview (what they can expect)
  - only the unit projects are graded. There will be projects in the udemy course and we highly encourage you to complete them all, but they are not required. 
  - each project is organized into 5 parts, so you should shoot to complete a part every day. 
  - moving faster than that is cool, but you don't want to fall behind. If you finish early I can supply bonus content. 
  - each project has an MVP, Code requirements and objectives. Pay attention to this, go over them before and after doing each project. This is a pattern you'll need to replicate for your capstone. 
  - There is a solution file. Obviously use it with descretion, but it's there for a reason. 
- Queue
  - It's really important to struggle and really try yourself before getting help. 
  - We WANT you to use the queue. The template is absolutely not meant to be a deterrant. But it's vital that you develop independent debugging and learning skills during the course.
